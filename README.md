### Your station for procrastination ;)

## WDCCxSESA Hackathon 2021
This application was made for the WDCCxSESA Hackathon for 2021, which had the theme of "Pro-crastination", not doing what you're supposed to as effectively as possible. It was a hackathon from Saturday 09:00 AM till Sunday 04:00 PM.

## Techstack
We have used a MERN stack for the application - MongoDB for the database, Express for the backend, ReactJS for the frontend, and lastly NodeJS for the backend as well.>
